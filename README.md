Goal is to determine whether client (Lending Club) should invest in P2P loans.

Lending club is a fintech online marketplace company which is essentially a peer-to-peer lending site, which matches borrowers with investors who are willing to fund the loans. Lending club is disrupting the financial market as it offers reasonable to high returns for lenders and lower interest rates for borrowers. Lending club screens potential borrowers and services the loans once they are approved (the investor makes the final decision whether to lend the money or not). The investor can take this decision based on Lending Club grade, utilizing credit and income data which is assigned to every borrower.
